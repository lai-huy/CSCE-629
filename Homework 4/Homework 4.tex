Make sure that you describe all solutions in your own words. Typeset
your solutions in \LaTeX. Read
chapters 30 and 15 in our textbook. 

\begin{problem} (20 points) Let $\omega$ be a primitive $n$th root of unity. 
The fast Fourier transform implements the multiplication with
  the matrix 
$$ F = (\omega^{ij})_{i,j\in [0..n-1]}.$$
Show that the inverse of the matrix $F$ is given by 
$$ F^{-1} = \frac{1}{n}  (\omega^{-jk})_{j,k\in [0..n-1]}$$
[Hint: $x^n-1= (x-1)(x^{n-1}+\cdots + x + 1),$ so any power
$\omega^\ell\neq 1$  must be a root of $x^{n-1}+\cdots + x + 1$.  ]  
Thus, the inverse FFT, called IFFT, is nothing but the FFT using
$\omega^{-1}$ instead of $\omega$, and multiplying the result with
$1/n$.

\begin{problem} (20 points) 
Describe in your own words how to do a polynomial multiplication using the FFT and
  IFFT for polynomials $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ of degree $\le n-1$. Make
  sure that you describe the length of the FFT and IFFT needed for
  this task. Be concise and precise. 
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem} (20 points) 
How can you modify the polynomial multiplication algorithm based
  on FFT and IFFT to do multiplication of long integers in base 10?
  Make sure that you take care of carries in a proper way. Write your
  algorithm in pseudocode and give a brief explanation.

\begin{problem}[20 points]
  Solve Exercise 15.3-4 on page 389 of our textbook. As stated, in
  dynamic programming we first solve the subproblems and then choose
  which of them to use in an optimal solution to the
  problem. Professor Capulet claims that we do not always need to
  solve all the subproblems in order to find an optimal solution. She
  suggests that we can find an optimal solution to the matrix-chain
  multiplication problem by always choosing the matrix $A_k$
  at which to split the subproduct $A_iA_{i+1}\cdots A_j$ (by selecting $k$ to minimize the
  quantity $p_{i-1}p_kp_j$) before solving the subproblems. Find an instance
  of the matrix-chain multiplication problem for which this greedy
  approach yields a suboptimal solution.

\begin{problem}[20 points]
  Solve Exercise 15.4-1 on page 396 of our textbook.
  Determine an LCS of $\langle 1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1\rangle$ and
  $\langle0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0\rangle$. Make sure that you explain your
  answer step-by-step, in detail, rather than just giving an LCS.
